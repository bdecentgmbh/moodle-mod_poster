      | username    | firstname | lastname  | email                |
      | student1    | Student   | 1         | student1@example.com |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname    | shortname | category  |
      | Course 001  | C1        | 0         |
    And the following "course enrolments" exist:
      | user        | course    | role              |
      | student1    | C1        | student           |

  Scenario: Description can be shown or hidden depending on the setting "Display description on view page"
    Given the following "activities" exist:
      | activity    | name                  | intro                         | course  | idnumber  | showdescriptionview |

    When I log in as "student1"
    And I am on "Course 001" course homepage
    And I follow "Poster 001"
    Then I should see "This is a test poster 001."
    And I am on "Course 001" course homepage
    And I follow "Poster 002"
    And I should not see "This is a test poster 002."
