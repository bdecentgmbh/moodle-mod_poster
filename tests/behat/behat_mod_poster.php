/**
 * Define the Poster module's behat steps.
 *
 * The poster module changes the default look & behaviour of the "add-block" widget so that it looks like the drop down
 * selector even in Boost based theme (where it would normally be displayed as a link in the flat navigation). As a
 * consequence, we can't use the default step {@link i_add_the_block()} because it would fail in Boost (the expected
 * link is not in the flat navigation).
 *
 * Instead, we define a custom step as a copy of the {@link behat_blocks::i_add_the_block()} that expects the default
 * drop down selector.
